# EMAIL-WEB-PROJECT
This project is a simple email-sending web application using Spring Boot for the backend and HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the frontend. Users can input a recipient's email address, subject, and message content, and the app sends the email via Gmail's SMTP server using JavaMailSender. The frontend provides a user-friendly form, while the backend handles request mapping and email delivery logic. To ensure secure email sending, the project uses Gmail App Passwords. This application demonstrates basic full-stack development and integration of email functionality in Java-based web applications.
